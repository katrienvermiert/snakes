# snakes
[snake game](https://katrienvermiert.github.io/snakes/)

made an update thursday evening because I didn't use index.html. At 7 o'clock I allready made following change in my code:
changing randomTen() to: return (Math.round(Math.random() * (max/10) + 1) * 10); --> snake eats food :)
This change was made after the test finished.
